# NLP group project - Zero Shot Image Classification

## Dataset 

The `links.txt` file contains the animalia links for 1570 species that could be used to build our dataset.

You can verify that it contains no duplicates using (on UNIX) `sort links.txt | uniq -d`, this looks at all the links and calculates duplicates. If there are no duplicates, the output should be empty.
