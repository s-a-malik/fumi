It is notable for having chicks that have claws on two of their wing digits. The hoatzin has an unfeathered blue face with maroon eyes, and its head is topped by a spiky, rufous crest. The long, sooty-brown tail is broadly tipped buff. The upperparts are dark, sooty-brown-edged buff on the wing coverts, and streaked buff on the mantle and nape. The under parts are buff, while the crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca), primaries, underwing coverts, and flanks are rich rufous-chestnut, but this is mainly visible when it opens its wings."
common musk turtle,sternotherus odoratus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Testudines_Cryptodira_Kinosternidae_Sternotherus_Sternotherus odoratus,"The Common musk turtle is a small turtle native to North America. It is black, grey, or brown in color and has a long neck and rather short legs. The yellow lines on the neck are a good field marker, and often can be seen from above in swimming turtles. Males can usually be distinguished from females by their significantly longer tails and by the spike that protrudes at the end of the tail. Females are also typically larger than males. The head of these turtles is vaguely triangular in shape, with a pointed snout and sharp beak, and yellow-green striping from the tip of the nose to the neck. Barbels are present on the chin and the throat. Their tiny tongues are covered in bud-like papillae that allow them to respire underwater."
harbor seal,phoca vitulina,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Pinnipedia_Phocidae_Phoca_Phoca vitulina,"The Harbor seal is relatively small in comparison with the many other seal species. Its color can vary from light gray, white or yellowish gray with darker spots, to gray, black or brown with spots or light rings. Its fur is short and thick, with coarse guard hair and dense, fine underhair. They have a gland in their skin which secretes oil to waterproof their fur. A Harbor seal has a round head and a short snout with a V-shaped nose, which it closes when under water. Its eyes are big, round and dark, it has ear openings, and long, droopy whiskers used for finding food underwater. Its front and hind flippers are short and webbed, and have five digits, with the first and fifth digits being longer than the middle ones. When its hind flippers are laid flat, they look like fans, and between them, it has a short, flattened tail."

african penguin,spheniscus demersus,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Sphenisciformes_Spheniscidae_Spheniscus_Spheniscus demersus,"The African penguin is a small to medium-sized penguin with black-and-white plumage, serving the animal as a perfect camouflage to protect from predators. Due to the black feathers on their back, they merge with the environment, remaining unseen for those looking down from above. Meanwhile, the white coloration on the front part of their body allows them to be unspotted by aquatic predators, looking up from below. The penguins have a horseshoe-shaped, white colored stripe on their face, stretching from around their eyes to their chest as well on the chin, towards the bill. Young penguins possess gray-blue feathers, which darken as they grow up."

One clear difference between them is the larger crest of the Cape fur seal."
red junglefowl,gallus gallus,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Galliformes_Phasianidae_Gallus_Gallus gallus,"The Red junglefowl is a tropical bird found across much of Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. It is the primary ancestor of the domestic chicken. Compared to the more familiar domestic chicken, the Red junglefowl has a much smaller body mass and is brighter in coloration. Junglefowl are also behaviourally different from domestic chickens; they are naturally very shy of humans compared to the much tamer domesticated subspecies. Male junglefowl are significantly larger than females and have brightly colored decorative feathers. The male's tail is composed of long, arching feathers that initially look black, but shimmer with blue, purple, and green in direct light. He also has long, golden hackle feathers on his neck and on his back. The female's plumage is typical of this family of birds in being cryptic and adapted for camouflage as she alone looks after the eggs and chicks. She also has a very small comb and wattles (fleshy ornaments on the head that signal good health to rivals and potential mates) compared to the males."
nanday parakeet,aratinga nenday,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Psittaciformes_Psittacidae_Aratinga_Aratinga nenday,"The Nanday parakeet is a medium-small, mostly green parrot native to South America.

striped skunk,mephitis mephitis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Mephitidae_Mephitis_Mephitis mephitis,"Striped skunks are the biggest of the skunk species. They are easily identifiable by the white stripe running from head to tail and each individual has a unique pattern of stripes. Skunks are intelligent and usually good natured. As members of the weasel family Mustelidae, they share the characteristics of a musky odor and well-developed scent glands. The skunk excels at this potential and can discharge a foul-smelling fluid as a means of defense. Its scientific name, mephitis, in Latin means “bad odor”. Most skunks do not survive their first year because of infectious disease and severe weather conditions. If they do survive, in the wild they can live for up to 7 years, and in captivity up to 10 years. They can run as fast as 16km/h (10mph)."

It seems perfectly designed as a climbing animal for exploiting the desert’s ledges, cracks and vertical cliffs. Their long tail provides them with balance for negotiating limbs and narrow ledges, and they can even reverse direction by doing a cartwheel. They are able to rotate their back feet 180 degrees, providing them with purchase for the rapid descent of cliffs, trees or cacti. In addition, ringtails can go up narrow passages by “stemming,” which is pressing all four feet on one wall with their back against the opposite wall or pressing both their right feet against one wall and both their left feet against the other, and managing wider openings or cracks by ricocheting between the two walls."

mourning dove,zenaida macroura,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Columbiformes_Columbidae_Zenaida_Zenaida macroura,"Mourning doves live in the American southwest, as do several other species in the Columbidae or pigeon family. The genus name is in honor of Princess Zénaïde Charlotte Julie Bonaparte, who was the zoologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte’s wife and first cousin. Macroura means, “long-tailed”, referring, of course, to the bird’s long tail. Its plaintive ooAAH-cooo-coo-coo does sound like a bird in despair. Early naturalists believed this when they heard the “mournful” song. This anthropomorphic view is wrong. These birds are not mourning for lost ones, instead, their beautiful songs are meant for breeding purposes and territorial displays."

satin bowerbird,ptilonorhynchus violaceus,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Passeriformes_Ptilonorhynchidae_Ptilonorhynchus_Ptilonorhynchus violaceus,"Bowerbirds are very close relatives of birds-of-paradise, and bowerbird species occur in many parts of New Guinea and Australia. Males weave intricate display areas (called bowers) out of twigs, decorating their bowers with saliva, charcoal, and colorful objects. As a result, bowerbirds are often considered to be the most advanced species of bird. A bower is an attractive 'avenue' that male bowerbirds use to entice a female. Adult male and female satin bowerbirds share the same bright lilac-blue eyes but no other similarities in color, the male being black with a sheen of glossy purple-blue, and the female olive-green above, with off-white and dark scalloping on her lower parts, with brown wings and tail.

This call, most often heard during the mating season in spring at dusk, is produced from the bird's specialized esophagus or food pipe, creating an especially powerful ‘booming’ quality. This stocky bird seems to materialize among reeds and to disappear as quickly, particularly when in its concealment pose, where it stretches its neck and points its bill skyward. These stealthy birds stand motionless amongst tall marsh vegetation, or will patiently stalk fish, frogs, or insects."
spotted turtle,clemmys guttata,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Testudines_Cryptodira_Emydidae_Clemmys_Clemmys guttata,"The Spotted turtle is a small, semi-aquatic turtle found in North America. Its upper shell (carapace) is smooth and does not have a central ridge running down the middle (called a ""keel""). It is also totally black in color and contains anywhere from zero to about one hundred yellow spots, which are a defining characteristic of this turtle. The bottom shell (plastron) is yellow or orange-yellow and a black spot is present on each section (scute); however, with age, melanism of the plastron increases until the entire surface is black. On each side of the head there is a large orange blotch. Skin on the dorsal side of the turtle is black with sparse yellow spots while skin on the ventral side may be brighter: orange, pink, or red.

This bird is also known as the chaparral cock, ground cuckoo, and snake killer. Although capable of limited flight, it spends most of its time on the ground and can run at speeds up to 32 km/h (20 mph). There were even cases when roadrunners have run as fast as 42 km/h (26 mph). This is the fastest running speed clocked for a flying bird that also helps it to be a very effective predator. It is able to capture not only snakes but also chase fast-running lizards and rodents."

This mysterious scavenger is also identified as a mythical bird in Iran and northwest Asia. It is essentially unmistakable with other vultures or indeed other birds in flight due to its long, narrow wings and long, wedge-shaped tail. Unlike most vultures, the Bearded vulture does not have a bald head. The bird is relatively small-headed, although its neck is powerful and thick. The gait on the ground is waddling and the feet are large and powerful. The adult is mostly dark gray, rusty, and whitish in color. It is grey-blue to grey-black above. The creamy-colored forehead contrasts against a black band across the eyes and lores and bristles under the chin, which form a black beard that give the bird its English name. Bearded vultures are variably orange or rust of plumage on their head, breast, and leg feathers. This coloration may come from dust-bathing, rubbing mud on its body, or from drinking in mineral-rich waters."

The color pattern of adders varies, ranging from very light-coloured specimens with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, and on to melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most have some kind of zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks. Unusually for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the color. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. Melanistic individuals are often females."

The common name, spiny softshell, refers to the spiny, cone-like projections on the leading edge of the turtle's carapace, which are not scutes (scales). These spines are more commonly found in males. Spiny softshell turtles have webbed feet, and their feet have three claws. Another distinguishing feature of softshell turtles is the presence of a fleshy, elongated nose. The carapace (the upper part of the shell) ranges from brown or yellow-brown to olive in color, while the plastron (lower part of the shell) is lighter, usually white or yellow. Hatchlings usually have dark spots on the carapace, but as females age, they frequently become darker in color, or their carapace becomes splotched. Males tend to maintain the same coloration pattern from birth. Coloration also varies between each subspecies, and the exact coloration can also depend on an individual turtle's environment. Spiny softshell turtles are cryptically colored, meaning that their coloration helps them blend in with their surrounding environment. Spiny softshells also have pale lines bordered by black lines running from their head down the side of their neck."

These are ducks with stout, scoop-shaped bills, and long, stiff tails they often hold cocked upward. They have slightly peaked heads and fairly short, thick necks. Males have blackish caps that contrast with bright white cheeks. In summer, they have rich chestnut bodies with bright blue bills. In winter, they are dull gray-brown above and paler below with dull gray bills. Females and first-year males are brownish, somewhat like winter males but with a blurry stripe across the pale cheek patch. In flight, Ruddy ducks show solidly dark tops of the wings."
marsh wren,cistothorus palustris,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Passeriformes_Troglodytidae_Cistothorus_Cistothorus palustris,Marsh wrens are small North American songbirds. Adults have brown upperparts with a light brown belly and flanks and a white throat and breast. Their back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.
african buffalo,syncerus caffer,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Bovidae_Bovinae_Syncerus_Syncerus caffer,"African buffalo are large, heavy cow-like animals native to Africa. They are widely regarded as among the most dangerous animals on the African continent, and according to some estimates they gore, trample, and kill over 200 people every year. Compared with other large bovids, African buffalo have a long but stocky body and short but thickset legs, resulting in a relatively short standing height. The adult buffalo's horns are its characteristic feature: they have fused bases, forming a continuous bone shield across the top of the head referred to as a ""boss"". Savannah-type buffalo have black or dark brown coats with age. Old bulls often have whitish circles around their eyes and on their face. Females tend to have more-reddish coats. Forest-type buffaloes are 30-40% smaller, reddish-brown in color, with much more hair growth around the ears and with horns that curve back and slightly up. Calves of both types have red coats."
eurasian collared dove,streptopelia decaocto,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Columbiformes_Columbidae_Streptopelia_Streptopelia decaocto,"During the 20th century, the Eurasian collared dove spectacularly expanded its range from the Middle East to right across Europe. Accidentally introduced in 1974 into the Bahamas, this pale chunky bird soon spread to the mainland in Florida. A relative of the mourning dove, its name comes from its black half-collar around its neck. It has white tail feathers and dark-tipped wings. It is often seen on fence posts and telephone wires, giving its rhythmic three-part coo."
brahminy blind snake,indotyphlops braminus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Typhlopidae_Indotyphlops_Indotyphlops braminus,"The Brahminy blind snake is a nonvenomous blind snake species found mostly in Africa and Asia but has been introduced in many other parts of the world. They are completely fossorial (i.e., burrowing) animals, with habits and appearance similar to earthworms, for which they are often mistaken. Brahminy blind snakes are the smallest known snake species in the world. Their head and tail are superficially similar as the head and neck are indistinct. Unlike other snakes, the head scales resemble the body scales. The eyes are barely discernible as small dots under the head scales. The tip of the tail has a small, pointed spur. Along the body are fourteen rows of dorsal scales. Coloration ranges from charcoal gray, silver-gray, light yellow-beige, purplish, or infrequently albino, the ventral surface is more pale. The coloration of the juvenile form is similar to that of the adult. The tiny eyes are covered with translucent scales which means that these snakes are almost entirely blind. Their eyes cannot form images but can react to light intensity."
corn snake,pantherophis guttatus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Colubridae_Pantherophis_Pantherophis guttatus,"The Corn snake is a North American species of rat snake. Their docile nature, reluctance to bite, moderate adult size, attractive pattern, and comparatively simple care make them commonly kept pet snakes. Though superficially resembling the venomous copperhead and often killed as a result of this mistaken identity, Corn snakes are harmless and beneficial to humans. These snakes are usually orange or yellowish-brown in color with large, black-edged red blotches down their back. There are black and white marks on their bellies, which resemble a checkerboard pattern. Corn snakes are named for their regular presence near grain stores, where they prey on mice and rats that eat harvested corn."
american golden plover,pluvialis dominica,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Charadriiformes_Charadriidae_Pluvialis_Pluvialis dominica,"The American golden plover is a medium-sized wading bird that makes one of the longest migratory journeys of any shorebird. The breeding male has a black face, neck, breast, and belly, with a white crown and nape that extends to the side of the breast. The back is mottled black and white with pale, gold spots. The breeding female is similar, but with less black. When in winter plumage, both sexes have grey-brown upperparts, pale gray-brown underparts, and a whitish eyebrow. The American golden plover looks very similar to the Pacific golden plover with which it was once considered the same species under the name ""lesser golden plover""."
northern map turtle,graptemys geographica,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Testudines_Cryptodira_Emydidae_Graptemys_Graptemys geographica,"The Northern map turtle is an aquatic turtle native to North America. It gets both its common and scientific names from the markings on its carapace, which resemble contour lines on a map or chart. These lines are usually shades of yellow, tan, or orange, and are surrounded by dark borders, with the rest of the carapace being olive or greyish brown. However, the carapace markings tend to fade as the animal matures, and in older individuals are usually only visible when the shell is wet. The plastron is yellowish and is marked by a central dark blotch (plastral figure) that follows the sutures of the plastral scutes and fades with age so that many adults lack a pattern all together. The head, neck, limbs, and tail are dark green with thin yellow stripes, and an oval or triangular spot is located behind each eye. Females have a much wider head than males and this is associated with differences in feeding. Males have a narrower carapace with a more distinct keel, narrower head, and a longer, thicker tail."
burrowing owl,athene cunicularia,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Strigiformes_Strigidae_Athene_Athene cunicularia,"Burrowing owls are small, long-legged birds of prey found throughout open terrains of North and South America. They have bright eyes and their beaks can be dark yellow or gray depending on the subspecies. They have prominent white eyebrows and a white ""chin"" patch which they expand and display during certain behaviors, such as a bobbing of the head when agitated. Adults have brown heads and wings with white spotting. The chest and abdomen are white with variable brown spotting or barring, also depending on the subspecies. Juvenile owls are similar in appearance, but they lack most of the white spotting above and brown barring below; their breast may be buff-colored rather than white. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, Burrowing owls have developed longer legs that enable them to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting."
