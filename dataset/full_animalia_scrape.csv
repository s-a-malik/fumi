pallas's cat,otocolobus manul,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Feliformia_Felidae_Otocolobus_Otocolobus manul,"Pallas’s cat is similar in size to a domestic cat but it looks much bigger because of its stocky build and its long, thick coat, which helps protect it in its frosty habitat. Its shaggy coat is especially thick on its belly to protect it from the snow while stalking prey. Their fur changes color depending on the season, in winter being a frosted gray and in spring a gray/fox-red. The pupils of its large eyes, unlike those of other small cats, contract to small circles instead of slits."
etruscan shrew,suncus etruscus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Eulipotyphla_Soricidae_Suncus_Suncus etruscus,"The Etruscan shrew is the smallest known mammal by mass. It weighs only around 1.8 grams (0.063 oz) on average. The Etruscan shrew is characterized by very rapid movements and a fast metabolism, eating about 1.5-2 times its own body weight per day. The head of these small animals is relatively large, with a long, mobile proboscis, and the hind limbs are relatively small. The ears are relatively large and protuberant. The fur color on the back and sides are pale brown but is light gray on the stomach. The fur becomes denser and thicker from fall through the winter. Near the mouth grow a dense array of short whiskers, which shrews actively use to search for prey, especially in the night."
antarctic minke whale,balaenoptera bonaerensis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Cetacea_Balaenopteridae_Balaenoptera_Balaenoptera bonaerensis,"Antarctic minke whales are among the smallest and most common of the rorqual whales, the largest number of baleen whales. These whales are noticeably more streamlined than other types of whales, being long and slender. An Antarctic minke whale has a pointed snout which is distinctively narrow, triangular, and pointed (thus the nicknames ""little piked whale"" and ""sharp-headed finner"") and a pair of blowholes; the upper part of its head is flat and broad). The upperparts of the whale are dark gray, while its underbelly is white, the flippers are pale and there are pale streaks on its sides."
oriental small-clawed otter,aonyx cinerea,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Mustelidae_Lutrinae_Amblonyx_Aonyx cinerea,"Oriental small-clawed otters are the smallest of the otter species. Their name comes from their very small claws. This species relies on their dexterous and sensitive fingers to forage for prey, and so lack the long claws most otters have. Due to this, there is also less webbing between the digits than other otters have. These small animals, of no more than several pounds in weight and no longer than a common rat, have gray/brown fur (with a lighter coloration on their underside, neck and face). Their slender, almost serpentine build is complemented by a large tail. They have stubby legs and blunt faces."
brush-tailed phascogale,phascogale tapoatafa,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Marsupialia_Dasyuromorphia_Dasyuridae_Phascogale_Phascogale tapoatafa,"The magnificent Brush-tailed phascogale has an unusual ‘bottle brush’ tail, which is covered with long, silky, black colored hairs that can be erected on occasion. The head and body of this marsupial are grizzled grey, while the under parts are pale cream. Females of this species have a 'fake' pouch: they simply have a pouch area, exhibiting noticeably coarser, brown colored hairs with light tips. Males of this species show die-off shortly after mating, without even reaching 1 year old. Life expectancy of females is up to 3 years."
hoatzin,opisthocomus hoazin,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Opisthocomiformes_Opisthocomidae_Opisthocomus_Opisthocomus hoazin,"The Hoatzin is a tropical bird native to South America. It is notable for having chicks that have claws on two of their wing digits. The hoatzin has an unfeathered blue face with maroon eyes, and its head is topped by a spiky, rufous crest. The long, sooty-brown tail is broadly tipped buff. The upperparts are dark, sooty-brown-edged buff on the wing coverts, and streaked buff on the mantle and nape. The under parts are buff, while the crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca), primaries, underwing coverts, and flanks are rich rufous-chestnut, but this is mainly visible when it opens its wings."
common musk turtle,sternotherus odoratus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Testudines_Cryptodira_Kinosternidae_Sternotherus_Sternotherus odoratus,"The Common musk turtle is a small turtle native to North America. It is black, grey, or brown in color and has a long neck and rather short legs. The yellow lines on the neck are a good field marker, and often can be seen from above in swimming turtles. Males can usually be distinguished from females by their significantly longer tails and by the spike that protrudes at the end of the tail. Females are also typically larger than males. The head of these turtles is vaguely triangular in shape, with a pointed snout and sharp beak, and yellow-green striping from the tip of the nose to the neck. Barbels are present on the chin and the throat. Their tiny tongues are covered in bud-like papillae that allow them to respire underwater."
southern american bushmaster,lachesis muta,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Viperidae_Lachesis_Lachesis muta,"Southern American bushmasters are venomous pit vipers found in South America. They are the third longest venomous snakes in the world. Their head is broad and distinct from the narrow neck. The snout is broadly rounded. The color pattern consists of a yellowish, reddish or grey-brown ground color, overlaid with a series of dark brown or black dorsal blotches; these blotches form lateral inverted triangles of the same color. The lateral pattern may be precisely or indistinctly defined, normally pale at the center."
perentie,varanus giganteus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Varanidae_Varanus_Varanus giganteus,"The Perentie is the largest monitor lizard native to Australia, and the fourth-largest living lizard on earth.

harbor seal,phoca vitulina,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Pinnipedia_Phocidae_Phoca_Phoca vitulina,"The Harbor seal is relatively small in comparison with the many other seal species. Its color can vary from light gray, white or yellowish gray with darker spots, to gray, black or brown with spots or light rings. Its fur is short and thick, with coarse guard hair and dense, fine underhair. They have a gland in their skin which secretes oil to waterproof their fur. A Harbor seal has a round head and a short snout with a V-shaped nose, which it closes when under water. Its eyes are big, round and dark, it has ear openings, and long, droopy whiskers used for finding food underwater. Its front and hind flippers are short and webbed, and have five digits, with the first and fifth digits being longer than the middle ones. When its hind flippers are laid flat, they look like fans, and between them, it has a short, flattened tail."
greater bird-of-paradise,paradisaea apoda,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Passeriformes_Paradisaeidae_Paradisaea_Paradisaea apoda,"The Greater bird-of-paradise is the biggest member of the genus Paradisaea. These birds were named by Carolus Linnaeus as ""legless bird of paradise"" or Greater birds-of-paradise because natives prepared early trade-skins for Europe without feet, resulting in the misconception that these beautiful birds were visitors from paradise kept aloft by means of their plumes and only touched the earth when they died. The male has large yellow ornamental plumes on its flanks and two long tail wires, whereas the female has brown plumage. Their lifespan is unknown but generally birds-of-paradise live 5-8 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity"
blue monkey,cercopithecus mitis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Primates_Haplorhini_Simiiformes_Cercopithecidae_Cercopithecinae_Cercopithecini_Cercopithecus_Cercopithecus mitis,"Despite what the common name suggests, the Blue monkey is not blue. In fact, the species is so called due to the hairless face, which seems to be colored in blue. This Old world monkey is of great interest for scientists. The primate has a dark head top. The coloration of the body is mainly olive or grey. Additionally, the Blue monkey exhibits some black and white markings all over its body."
carpet python,morelia spilota,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Pythonidae_Morelia_Morelia spilota,"The Carpet python is a large snake named for beautiful markings on its skin, which resemble an oriental carpet pattern. Their coloring is highly variable, ranging from olive to black with white or cream and gold markings.

snowy egret,egretta thula,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Neornithes_Neognathae_Neoaves_Pelecaniformes_Ardeidae_Egretta_Egretta thula,"The Snowy egret is a small but elegant white heron. Adults are entirely white in color apart from the yellow lores between the long black bill and the eye, black legs, and bright yellow feet. The nape and neck bear long, shaggy plumes known as aigrettes. Immature Snowy egrets have duller, greenish legs."
gray jay,perisoreus canadensis,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Passeriformes_Corvidae_Perisoreus_Perisoreus canadensis,"The Gray jay is a fairly large songbird that lives in the boreal forests of North America. It has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. These birds live year-round on permanent territories, surviving in cold winter months on food cached throughout their territory in warmer periods. They also adapt to human activity in their areas and approach humans for food, inspiring a list of colloquial names including ""lumberjack"", ""camp robber"", and ""venison-hawk""."
fiordland penguin,eudyptes pachyrhynchus,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Sphenisciformes_Spheniscidae_Eudyptes_Eudyptes pachyrhynchus,"The Fiordland penguin is a medium-sized penguin with a wide, yellow band on its eyebrow, which starts at each nostril, stretching above the eyes down the neck, and forming a crest. The orange beak is relatively large, bordered with a thin line of black skin at its base. Meanwhile, beaks of males are noticeably larger than these of females. Their under parts are silky white while the upper parts are blue-grey/black, being darker on the head. By the time of their annual molt, the upper parts usually become brown. When the bird is nervous, 3-6 whitish streaks appear on its cheeks. The Fiordland penguin has brownish red eyes. The upper parts of feet and legs are pinkish-white, while the soles and back parts of the limbs are blackish-brown. Juveniles are identified by short, thin bands on their eyebrows, colored with pale yellow. In addition, the chin and throat of juveniles are whitish and speckled. After fledging, the chicks have bluish dorsal plumage, which wears out, eventually fading to black, and turning to mid-brown by their first molt."
african penguin,spheniscus demersus,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Sphenisciformes_Spheniscidae_Spheniscus_Spheniscus demersus,"The African penguin is a small to medium-sized penguin with black-and-white plumage, serving the animal as a perfect camouflage to protect from predators. Due to the black feathers on their back, they merge with the environment, remaining unseen for those looking down from above. Meanwhile, the white coloration on the front part of their body allows them to be unspotted by aquatic predators, looking up from below. The penguins have a horseshoe-shaped, white colored stripe on their face, stretching from around their eyes to their chest as well on the chin, towards the bill. Young penguins possess gray-blue feathers, which darken as they grow up."
northern treeshrew,tupaia belangeri,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Scandentia_Tupaiidae_Tupaia_Tupaia belangeri,"The Northern treeshrew is a brown colored mammal with short, furless ears and a large, wet nose. By its appearance, the Northern treeshrew reminds “Scrat” from the movie Ice Age. This animal is very similar to long nosed squirrels as well as some of the earliest mammals. Its eyes are large, dark and lashless. The Northern treeshrews exhibit short and inconspicuous whiskers. Their long, bushy tail is curved upwards. These animals are excellent climbers due to the sharp nails and naked pads on their feet."
song sparrow,melospiza melodia,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Passeriformes_Passerellidae_Melospiza_Melospiza melodia,"The Song sparrow is one of the most abundant, variable, and adaptable native sparrows in North America.

Hatchlings and juveniles have a greenish upper shell (carapace), yellow bottom shell (plastron), and green and yellow stripes and markings on their skin. These patterns and colors in the skin and shell fade with age until the carapace is a muted olive green to orange-brown or brown and the plastron is a dull yellow or darker. Some sliders become almost black with few visible markings. The carapace is oval with a bit of rounding and a central crest with knobs, but these features soften and fade with age, adults being smoother and flatter. Males typically have much longer front claws than adult females, while females usually have shorter, more slender tails than males."
rhinoceros iguana,cyclura cornuta,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Iguanidae_Cyclura_Cyclura cornuta,"The Rhinoceros iguana is an endangered species of iguana that lives on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. The largest in their genus, these iguanas vary in length and skin colors that range from a steely grey to dark green and even brown. Their name derives from the bony-plated pseudo-horn or outgrowth which resembles the horn of a rhinoceros on the iguana's snout."
common leopard gecko,eublepharis macularius,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Eublepharidae_Eublepharis_Eublepharis macularius,"Common leopard geckos are ground-dwelling lizards. They are larger than many other gecko species. Those found in the wild typically have more dark, dull, and drab colorations than those kept in captivity as pets. Those in captivity generally have an assortment of skin colors and patterns. The skin of a Common leopard gecko is very durable, which provides protection from the rough sand and rocky hills terrain of their dry environment. Their dorsal side is covered with small bumps, which gives a rough texture and appearance while their ventral side is thin, transparent, and smooth. Like all reptiles, Common leopard geckos shed their skin. Adults shed an average of once a month, while juveniles will sometimes shed twice as much."
canadian lynx,lynx canadensis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Feliformia_Felidae_Lynx_Lynx canadensis,"The Canadian lynx is a cat of medium size with characteristic long ear tufts, a flared facial ruff, and a short, bobbed tail that has a completely black tip.

Males are slightly bigger than females and there is not much geographic variation in size."
brown fur seal,arctocephalus pusillus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Pinnipedia_Otariidae_Arctocephalus_Arctocephalus pusillus,"The brown fur seal belongs to a large seal species from Australia and South Africa. Adult males are light grayish-brown with a dark brown belly, and a mane around the neck and shoulders that becomes a lighter color as they age. The female is browner, but still has a darker brown belly. The adult male's head is larger and wider than the female's, with a low brow, which the female does not have. Both males and females have a pointed snout, long whiskers, small ears, and forward-facing nostrils. They have large, thick flippers, which look black when wet. There are two subspecies of the brown fur seal: the Cape fur seal and the Australian fur seal. These subspecies are behaviorally and genetically very similar, but they occupy distinct ranges. One clear difference between them is the larger crest of the Cape fur seal."
red junglefowl,gallus gallus,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Galliformes_Phasianidae_Gallus_Gallus gallus,"The Red junglefowl is a tropical bird found across much of Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. It is the primary ancestor of the domestic chicken. Compared to the more familiar domestic chicken, the Red junglefowl has a much smaller body mass and is brighter in coloration. Junglefowl are also behaviourally different from domestic chickens; they are naturally very shy of humans compared to the much tamer domesticated subspecies. Male junglefowl are significantly larger than females and have brightly colored decorative feathers. The male's tail is composed of long, arching feathers that initially look black, but shimmer with blue, purple, and green in direct light. He also has long, golden hackle feathers on his neck and on his back. The female's plumage is typical of this family of birds in being cryptic and adapted for camouflage as she alone looks after the eggs and chicks. She also has a very small comb and wattles (fleshy ornaments on the head that signal good health to rivals and potential mates) compared to the males."
nanday parakeet,aratinga nenday,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Psittaciformes_Psittacidae_Aratinga_Aratinga nenday,"The Nanday parakeet is a medium-small, mostly green parrot native to South America.

This snake is infamous for being an invasive species responsible for extirpating the majority of the native bird population in Guam. The Brown tree snake is a member of the colubrid snakes, which is a group of roughly twenty-five species that are referred to as ""cat-eyed"" snakes for their vertical pupils. The snake is long and slender, which allows it to pass through tiny spaces in buildings, logs, and other shaded locations, where it seeks refuge during daylight. The coloration ranges from a lightly patterned brown to yellowish/green or even beige with red, saddle-shaped blotches. They are rear-fanged, have a large head in relation to their body, and can survive for extended periods of time without food."

philippine tarsier,carlito syrichta,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Primates_Tarsiidae_Carlito_Carlito syrichta,"Known as the “world’s smallest monkey” because of its similarity in appearance to that primate, tarsiers, along with lemurs, tree shrews and lorises, actually are members of a more primitive suborder of Prosimii or prosimian. They are amongst the oldest land species that have existed continuously in the Philippines, dating from the early Eocene period, 45 million years ago. The Philippine tarsier has various distinctive habits and characteristics that make it an object of both popular curiosity and scientific research. Its eyes are unique and are almost twice as big as those of humans, however, they cannot see from the corners. Its head can rotate as much as 180 degrees, so it is able to leap backward with great precision. In addition, enabled by adhesive discs on the soles of its limbs, tarsiers cling to branches either horizontally or vertically."

It was described by Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1896. Later, this small chameleon was introduced to Hawai. Jackson's chameleons are sometimes called Three-horned chameleons because males possess three brown horns: one on the nose (the rostral horn) and one above each superior orbital ridge above the eyes (preocular horns). The females generally have no horns, or instead, have traces of the rostral horn. Jackson's chameleons are usually bright green in color, with some individual animals having traces of blue and yellow, but like all chameleons, they change color quickly depending on the mood, health, and temperature. They also have a saw-tooth shaped dorsal ridge and no gular crest."

The crocodile has large scales on its body, which have a form of wide plates on the back, bony plates on the belly, and pebbly scales on the flanks and outside of the animal's legs."
amazon river dolphin,inia geoffrensis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Cetacea_Iniidae_Inia_Inia geoffrensis,"The Amazon River dolphin, or, otherwise called Boto dolphin is one of the five river dolphins and is the most famous species of the group. The body of this mammal is long and plump, whereas the fins remind paddles by their shape. In addition, the animal can be easily identified by having a ridge on its back instead of a dorsal fin. The Amazon River dolphin also stands out from other dolphin species due to its coloration, ranging from bluish grey to white, and, sometimes, pink. Some vertebrae of the dolphin are unfused, making the neck of the animal amazingly flexible, which allows the dolphin to move its head in almost all directions. The animals have been treated with suspicion by local people. Moreover, the Amazon River dolphin is a subject of numerous myths and tales. According to one of the stories, these animals become handsome men in order to seduce young women, coming to the water."

red spitting cobra,naja pallida,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Elapidae_Naja_Naja pallida,"The Red spitting cobra is a medium-sized species of spitting cobra native to Africa. This attractive snake is usually bright salmon-red in color contrasted with a broad black throat band and subocular teardrop markings. However, the color of Red spitting snakes usually varies depending on where in Africa they are found. For example, individuals from southern Kenya and northern Tanzania have an orange-red color, with a broad, dark blue, or black throat band. Some specimens may have two or three throat bands, but this is uncommon for specimens from East Africa. The ventral side is also reddish in color, sometimes the throat area may be a creamy white. Red spitting cobras from other areas can be yellow, pinkish, pink-grey, pale red, or steel grey. Most specimens will have a throat band, but it will fade or even sometimes disappear in larger adults. The true red specimens will become reddish-brown in color as they age and grow in size."

The plastron (bottom shell) is yellow to reddish-orange with a dark pattern between scutes that follows the scute seams (this fades with age). Females tend to grow larger than males and have a smaller tail and more convex plastron. One particularly distinctive feature of River cooters is that they have the ability to breathe underwater through a sac called the cloaca bursae which is based on their tail. This allows them to stay underwater for extended periods of time and makes their behavior harder to study."

Their skin is usually gray in color reinforced by armored scales, which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain-mail. This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin a poor source of leather. Additionally, these osteoderms become more extensive and variable in shape as the Komodo dragon ages, ossifying more extensively as the lizard grows. These osteoderms are absent in hatchlings and juveniles, indicating that the natural armor develops as a product of age and competition between adults for protection in combats over food and mates."

The Lion-tailed macaque is endemic and native exclusively to Western Ghats (India). It's a living proof of the amazing diversity of its mountain rainforest habitat. As a result of its shy and solitary nature, this animal doesn't tend to venture from its usual range, travelling only within its rainforest habitat."
tufted puffin,fratercula cirrhata,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Charadriiformes_Alcidae_Fratercula_Fratercula cirrhata,"Tufted puffins are colorful seabirds, also known as “parrots of the sea” that spend winters in the open ocean and return to shore only to breed. They are found throughout the North Pacific Ocean and are easily recognizable by their thick red bill and yellow tufts. These tufts appear annually on birds of both sexes as the summer reproductive season approaches. Their feet become bright red and their face also becomes bright white in the summer. During the winter feeding season, the tufts molt off and the plumage, beak, and legs lose much of their lustre. Juveniles resemble winter adults, but with a grey-brown breast, shading to white on the belly, and a shallow, yellowish-brown bill."

Apart from being a member of the big four snakes in India, Russell's viper is also responsible for causing the most snakebite incidents and deaths among all venomous snakes. These snakes are deep yellow, tan, or brown in color, with three series of dark brown spots that run the length of the body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots."

southern tamandua,tamandua tetradactyla,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Pilosa_Myrmecophagidae_Tamandua_Tamandua tetradactyla,"The Southern tamandua is a unique anteater, which is equally arboreal and terrestrial. This animal is nicknamed 'lesser anteater' due to being smaller that the related giant anteater. The odd appearance of this anteater is highly beneficial for the animal, especially for populations in Central and South American forests and scrublands. Thus, when feeding at an anthill, the curly hair protects the tamandua from angry ants, trying to reach its skin. The forefeet of Southern tamandua have 4 toes, where the third toe has an extremely long claw, due to which tamandua has to walk on the outside edges of its forelegs in order not to stab its feet with its own claws."

This cute animal has a baby-like face, unusually large ears, plump belly and an extremely long tail, which occasionally drag on the ground while the animal walks. Compared to other Asian elephants, Borneo elephant is a more gentle-natured animal. In the past, Pygmy elephants were considered descendants of a domesticated elephant herd, which was given to the Sultan of Sulu in the 17th century. According to WWF, Borneo elephants genetically differ from other Asian elephants. This statement is supported by DNA evidence, which discovered that the species was isolated from their relatives on mainland Asia and Sumatra around 300,000 years ago. As a result, Borneo elephants became smaller, developing larger ears, longer tails and straighter tusks in course of time."

Males and females look very different from each other, the males having a dark brown or black coat with beady yellow-orange eyes and black tufted ears, while the females have such a different appearance that for a long time they were thought to belong to a different species. Females are tawny on the head and back, with rich-chestnut brown to golden-brown underparts. Their limbs have paler fur and their tails are a darker chestnut brown. Their ears have big tufts like the males, but the hair is white, and is long enough to extend around their cheeks."
amerian pika,ochotona princeps,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Lagomorpha_Ochotonidae_Ochotona_Ochotona princeps,"The American pika is a small rabbit that lives in alpine regions of the south-west of Canada and in the west of the U.S. It is a relatively smaller and cuter member of the lagomorph family of rabbits and hares. American pikas are hardworking herbivores that gather flowers and plants to store for winter. The polar bear has for years been the global warming movement’s symbol. But the American pika today has good reason to compete for this unwanted honor with the polar bear. These rabbits are suffering as a result of global warming bringing higher temperatures to their high, cool, moist mountain ecosystems. Higher temperatures can make pikas overheat, and they live so high up that there is nowhere else for them to go."

In some cases, each pair of spots may be united toward the neck area, forming a series of cross-bars over the back. There is also a very indistinct series of dark spots running along each of the flanks. These four series of spots along the body overlay four parallel, rather shadowy stripes that also run down the back and flanks. On the top of the head is a dark marking which is often in the shape of a crown, giving rise to the generic name of this snake Coronella (which means coronet). A relatively thick dark stripe extends from each nostril, through the eye, and along the side of the head to a little beyond the neck.

It is believed by some scientists that there are more of them than all the other seal species combined. Crabeater seals are a ""true"" or ""earless"" seal and perfectly adapted to living in Antarctica, almost exclusively amidst the pack ice. They are faster than most ""true"" seals and can travel faster over ice than a person can run. Ironically, these seals do not, in fact, eat crabs (Antarctic waters have no crabs), but they eat more krill than any other animal. It was the early Antarctic sealers and whalers who misnamed this species, which might more accurately be named the ""krilleater seal”. This seal’s abundance is largely a result of the slaughter in Antarctic whales of baleen whales, which made krill more available for seals and penguins."

Its rich musical call is one of its most remarkable features, being a series of bell-like staccato, then a loud ‘plop’. It is also surprising that this sound is ventriloquial - the bellbird can throw its voice, sounding as though it is off to your left a few meters, then fifty meters on your right, then behind you, making it difficult to establish the bird’s location. There is little information about the Crested bellbird’s lifespan."

This is the smallest of the African pythons. The name ""ball python"" refers to the animal's tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened. A common belief is that another name ""royal python"" comes from the legend that rulers in Africa, especially Cleopatra, would wear the python as jewelry. Ball pythons are stocky, with a relatively small head. The scales are smooth and both sexes have anal spurs on either side of the vent. The color pattern is typically black or dark brown with light brown or gold sides and dorsal blotches. The belly is a white or cream that may include scattered black markings. However, those in the pet industries have, through selective breeding, developed many morphs (genetic mutations) with altered colors and patterns."

black rhinoceros,diceros bicornis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Perissodactyla_Rhinocerotidae_Diceros_Diceros bicornis,"Rhinos are very ancient animals. In fact, these mammals do resemble some prehistoric species. They appeared millions of years ago, during the Miocene era. One of the most conspicuous characteristics of these animals is two horns of their head. African rhinos are represented by 2 species - the White rhino and Black rhino. These two animals differ from each other in a number of ways. Their names refer not to their color pattern, but to the shape of their lips. Black rhinos, for example, exhibit prehensile upper lips, which can grasp objects and help the animals to collect plants into their mouth. African rhinos can occasionally be unpredictable and extremely dangerous. Hence, they have been fiercely persecuted. As a result, during a short period from 1970 to 1992, they lost as much as 96% of their total population. This became the largest population decline among all species of rhino. Black rhinos are represented by 4 sub-species, 3 of which are currently classified as 'critically endangered' on the IUCN Red List."

They can usually be sexed by the color of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females."
rüppell's vulture,gyps rueppelli,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Accipitriformes_Accipitridae_Aegypiinae_Gyps_Gyps rueppelli,"Rüppell's vultures are big vultures ranging across a good part of central Africa. Their name comes from the 19th century German zoologist and explorer Eduard Rüppell. Being social birds, they nest in colonies of about 100 pairs in a mountainous habitat. They are scavengers, eating only carcasses and the remains of other dead animals. Their lack of hunting is not laziness or weakness - these birds can soar to incredible heights, searching for carrion, holding the record for flying higher than any other bird. An aircraft has collided with one of them at 37,000 feet."
golden bamboo lemur,hapalemur aureus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Primates_Strepsirrhini_Lemuridae_Hapalemur_Hapalemur aureus,"Golden bamboo lemurs are amongst most endangered mammals in the world. They have pale orange fur on their backs with brown to gray guard hairs and yellowish undersides. Their face is black, with a short muzzle, and golden cheeks, throat, and eyebrows and short hairy ears. The males and females are usually similar in appearance, with females often being slightly more grayish on their backs."
laysan albatross,phoebastria immutabilis,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Procellariiformes_Diomedeidae_Phoebastria_Phoebastria immutabilis,"The graceful glide of this bird among the waves and winds of the Pacific Ocean is a marvelous sight. The Laysan albatross is an expert soarer and can travel hundreds of miles in a day with scarcely a wing beat. Its name is due to being the only specimen that lives on Laysan Island. It nests on islands in the tropical Pacific, but will feed in Japan, California or the Aleutian Islands. In 1983 the famous British zoologist Lionel Walter Rothschild illustrated this species as Diomedia Immutabilis."
alpaca,vicugna pacos,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Camelidae_Vicugna_Vicugna pacos,"Alpaca is a domesticated species of camelid. In fact, Alpaca is the smallest of camelid family, having slim neck and body. Their heads, as well as the whole body, are slender while ears are, conversely, large and acuminate. Some alpacas have unicolorous wool, while others’ coat is varicolored, including about 22 colors: from black to white, from ginger to brown. Lower and upper incisors, along with lower canines, serve adult males as fighting teeth."
common bottlenose dolphin,tursiops truncatus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Cetacea_Delphinidae_Tursiops_Tursiops truncatus,"Bottlenose dolphins are the most well-known and common type of dolphin. They feature front flippers, flukes and a dorsal fin, which they use for swimming. The dorsal fin, positioned near the middle of the back, is tall and curved. These dolphins are usually black to a light gray, with white bellies, which are sometimes slightly pink. This coloring makes it hard to see them, from both above and below. Sometimes they have spots on their bellies and a stripe from the eye to the base of the flipper. These dolphins have 18 to 28 conical shaped teeth in each side of each jaw."
common european adder,vipera berus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Viperidae_Vipera_Vipera berus,"The Common European adder is a venomous snake that is extremely widespread and can be found throughout most of Western Europe and as far as East Asia. The color pattern of adders varies, ranging from very light-coloured specimens with small, incomplete, dark dorsal crossbars to entirely brown ones with faint or clear, darker brown markings, and on to melanistic individuals that are entirely dark and lack any apparent dorsal pattern. However, most have some kind of zigzag dorsal pattern down the entire length of their bodies and tails. The head usually has a distinctive dark V or X on the back. A dark streak runs from the eye to the neck and continues as a longitudinal series of spots along the flanks. Unusually for snakes, the sexes are possible to tell apart by the color. Females are usually brownish in hue with dark-brown markings, the males are pure grey with black markings. The basal colour of males will often be slightly lighter than that of the females, making the black zigzag pattern stand out. Melanistic individuals are often females."
guinea baboon,papio papio,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Primates_Haplorhini_Simiiformes_Cercopithecidae_Cercopithecinae_Papionini_Papio_Papio papio,"Guinea baboons are Old World baboons with large bodies and defined sexual dimorphism, expressed by long canines. This species is otherwise called the 'Red baboon' due to the red color pattern of its fur. The Guinea baboon is distinguished by its considerably long molars and broad incisors. The front and hind limbs are almost the same length. The digits on all of their feet are short and stout. Hence, these primates are unable to climb. Guinea baboons have a social system, where males protect females and young."
wandering albatross,diomedea exulans,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Procellariiformes_Diomedeidae_Diomedea_Diomedea exulans,"Described as ""The bird which made the breeze to blow"" the wingspan of a Wandering albatross is the longest of any bird. It lives up to its name when it takes fishing trips that last 10-20 days and can cover 10,000 km, while using hardly more energy than when sitting on its nest. Despite its large size, this bird is wonderfully adapted for soaring flight, and is able to glide for hours before needing to flap its wings in order to regain height. A Wandering albatross spends all its time at sea, aside from when it is breeding, far from even any islands. It sleeps on the water’s surface, during the day gliding and flying, searching for food, which is abundant."
common ringtail possum,pseudocheirus peregrinus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Marsupialia_Diprotodontia_Pseudocheiridae_Pseudocheirinae_Pseudocheirus_Pseudocheirus peregrinus,"About the same size as a cat, the common ringtail possum is gray, with orange-brown tinges on its legs and tail, and white patches on its belly and behind the eyes, and a white tip to its tail. It uses its long prehensile tail as a fifth limb to enable it to climb and jump from branch to branch and between fences and powerlines. The gap between its second and third fingers on its forefeet means that it can hold onto branches securely."
pacific golden plover,pluvialis fulva,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Charadriiformes_Charadriidae_Pluvialis_Pluvialis fulva,"The Pacific golden plover is a medium-sized wading bird that breeds in the Arctic tundra. During this time the adult is spotted gold and black on the crown, and back on the wings. Its face and neck are black with a white border, and it has a black breast and a dark rump. The legs are black. In winter, the black is lost and the plover then has a yellowish face and breast, and white underparts."
alpine chipmunk,neotamias alpinus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Rodentia_Sciuridae_Neotamias_Neotamias alpinus,Alpine chipmunks are gray-brown overall with muted orange flanks.

Its fur is in a marbled grey and black pattern, while the muzzle, eyestripe, and crown are all black. A light band runs across the forehead anterior to the ears, which are rounded and naked. There are sensory facial bristles in tufts above each eye, as well as whiskers. The Water opossum's tail furred and black at the base is yellow or white at its end. Its hind feet are webbed, while the forefeet (""hands"") are not. The forefeet can be used to feel for and grab prey as the animal swims, propelled by its tail and webbed back feet."
sunda flying lemur,galeopterus variegatus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Dermoptera_Cynocephalidae_Galeopterus_Galeopterus variegatus,"The Sunda (or Malayan) flying lemur or “colugo” does not belong to the prosimian group like true lemurs, but is in a zoological order of its own, Dermoptera or ""skinwings"", which has only one genus and two species: the Philippine and Sunda flying lemurs. The latter is mottled grayish or brownish on its upper parts and is paler below. Flying lemurs do not actually fly, but glide from one tree to the next, by means of the patagium, a membrane that stretches from their forelimbs to their tail. There is little information about their life span but the oldest known individual in captivity lived to 17.5 years old."
pampas cat,leopardus pajeros,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Feliformia_Felidae_Felinae_Leopardus_Leopardus pajeros,"Pampas cats have the appearance of heavy set domestic cats. Their fur varies from soft and thick in colder areas to straw-like and thin in warmer climates. The color ranges from grayish-yellow and yellowish-white to brown, gray brown, light gray and silvery gray. Their underparts are cream or whitish, and are marked with black or brown spots. The coat may have red gray streaks or spots or may have almost no markings except for some brown bands on its legs and tail. Typically its front and back legs have distinctive bands of brown, and its short, bushy tail has somewhat indistinct black or brown rings. Long hairs on its back stand up when the cat is frightened or nervous, making the cat appear much larger than it really is."
black caiman,melanosuchus niger,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Crocodilia_Alligatoridae_Melanosuchus_Melanosuchus niger,"The Black caiman is the biggest of all species of alligator, some reaching six meters long. This impressive aquatic predator is the largest animal in the Amazon Basin. Superficially it looks like the American alligator, and its protective armored skin, as its name suggests, is dark in color. This skin color helps to camouflage it during its nocturnal hunts, and may also help to absorb heat. The lower jaw has bands of grey (brown in older animals) with white or pale yellow bands across their flanks. The banding fades gradually as the animal gets older."
przewalski's horse,equus ferus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Perissodactyla_Equidae_Equus_Equus ferus,"Przewalski's horse, otherwise known as P-horse, is named after Nikolai Przewalski (pronounced ""shuh-val-skee""), a Russian explorer. In 1870, he was the first to discover sub-species of this horse. As a matter of fact, this animal is the last surviving true wild horse, from which the domestic horse originates. Przewalski's horse is almost the same size as related plains zebra, African wild ass and the domesticated burro. However, this ungulate hasn't been domesticated."
steller sea lion,eumetopias jubatus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Pinnipedia_Otariidae_Eumetopias_Eumetopias jubatus,"Steller sea lions are the biggest of the eared seals (of the Otariidae family), a group including sea lions and fur seals. Male adults are two and a half times bigger than adult females and have large necks, with shoulders covered in a mane of coarse, long hair. The common name comes from George Wilhelm Steller, the German naturalist who in 1741 first described these seals. Eared seals can move their hind flippers independently, so they are particularly agile on land. Unlike true seals, this species swims using their fore flippers."
javan rhinoceros,rhinoceros sondaicus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Perissodactyla_Rhinocerotidae_Rhinoceros_Rhinoceros sondaicus,"The Javan rhinoceros is amongst the world’s rarest big mammals. It is prehistoric-looking, is a dusky gray color and has a single horn. Its hairless skin has several loose folds, which look like armor plating. Every Javan rhino lives in Indonesia’s Ujung Kulon National Park, which makes this species even more under threat of extinction. However, the numbers have been slowly increasing over the last five years and the establishment of a second population may soon mean that the species will have much-needed extra capacity. If the rhinos in Java are lost, the species will be extinct."
uinta chipmunk,neotamias umbrinus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Rodentia_Sciuridae_Neotamias_Neotamias umbrinus,"In some parts of its range, this medium-sized chipmunk is almost undistinguishable from other chipmunk species of the area. During the summer months, the Uinta chipmunk usually exhibits yellowish brown-grey to dark brown coloration with tingle; on its back, this rodent displays 3 wide, dark blackish-brown bands that stretch downwards and are alternated with 4 paler, grey to white colored bands; on both sides of its face, the chipmunk has 3 dark and 3 pale stripes. On the other hand, the winter coat of Uinta chipmunk is noticeably duller and more greyish with less prominent bands; the ears of the animal are black, while the under-parts are colored in very pale grey; the orange and black tail is fringed with paler hairs on the underside."

Males and females are generally alike but females average larger and heavier."
field vole,microtus agrestis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Rodentia_Cricetidae_Microtus_Microtus agrestis,"The Field Vole resembles a small mouse, but with a stouter body and shorter tail. Also known as 'field mice', these rodents are accomplished tunnel diggers, burrowing the ground in search of roots and bulbs, which they feed upon. In fact, the Field Vole is one of the most frequently found small rodents in the countryside of Britain and Europe. This animal doesn't tend to enter houses, but can often be seen in backyards. Its coat is greyish-brown on the upper-parts and creamy-grey on the under-parts. The ears of field vole are rounded and furred, while the eyes are less prominent as compared to mice."
anaconda,eunectes murinus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Boidae_Boinae_Eunectes murinus,"Anaconda or “Green Nconda” belongs to boa family and is one of the biggest existing snakes. Anaconda’s females are much bigger in size than males and have clearly marked sexual dimorphism. Anacondas are mainly olive-green with black spots all around their bodies. Anaconda’s head has clearly expressed orange-yellow stripes on both sides and is narrow for its body size. The eyes, located on the top of head, help anacondas observe the surroundings without coming out of water."
spiny softshell turtle,apalone spinifera,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Testudines_Cryptodira_Trionychidae_Apalone_Apalone spinifera,"The Spiny softshell turtle is one of the largest freshwater turtle species in North America. The common name, spiny softshell, refers to the spiny, cone-like projections on the leading edge of the turtle's carapace, which are not scutes (scales). These spines are more commonly found in males. Spiny softshell turtles have webbed feet, and their feet have three claws. Another distinguishing feature of softshell turtles is the presence of a fleshy, elongated nose. The carapace (the upper part of the shell) ranges from brown or yellow-brown to olive in color, while the plastron (lower part of the shell) is lighter, usually white or yellow. Hatchlings usually have dark spots on the carapace, but as females age, they frequently become darker in color, or their carapace becomes splotched. Males tend to maintain the same coloration pattern from birth. Coloration also varies between each subspecies, and the exact coloration can also depend on an individual turtle's environment. Spiny softshell turtles are cryptically colored, meaning that their coloration helps them blend in with their surrounding environment. Spiny softshells also have pale lines bordered by black lines running from their head down the side of their neck."
desert iguana,dipsosaurus dorsalis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Iguanidae_Dipsosaurus_Dipsosaurus dorsalis,"The Desert iguana is one of the most common lizards of the Sonoran and Mojave deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is pale gray-tan to cream in color with a light brown reticulated pattern on its back and sides. Down the center of the back is a row of slightly-enlarged, keeled dorsal scales that become slightly larger as you move down the back. The reticulated pattern gives way to brown spots near the back legs, turning into stripes along the tail. The belly is pale. During the breeding season, the sides become pinkish in both sexes."

It was first identified as a separate species in 2008 by S. Blair Hedges, a herpetologist from Pennsylvania State University. He named this snake in honor of his wife, Carla Ann Hass, a herpetologist who was also part of the discovery team. Barbados threadsnakes are said to be about as wide as a spaghetti noodle and are thought to be near the lower size limit for snakes, as young individuals need to attain a certain minimum size to find suitable food."
steller's jay,cyanocitta stelleri,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Passeriformes_Corvidae_Cyanocitta_Cyanocitta stelleri,"The Steller's jay is are colorful and noisy bird native to western North America. It has a blackish-brown, black, or dark blue head, depending on the latitude, with lighter streaks on the forehead. This dark coloring gives way from the shoulders and lower breast to silvery blue. The primaries and tail are a rich blue with darker barring. Birds in the eastern part of its range along the Great Divide have white markings on the head, especially over the eyes; birds further west have light blue markers and birds in the far west along the Pacific Coast have small, very faint, or no white or light markings at all."

The horns of bontebok are lyre-shaped and clearly ringed. They are found in both sexes and can reach a length of half a meter."
blackburnian warbler,setophaga fusca,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Passeriformes_Parulidae_Setophaga_Setophaga fusca,"Blackburnian warblers are small colorful songbirds that breed in eastern North America. In summer, males display dark gray backs and double white wing bars, with yellowish rumps and dark brown crowns. The underparts of these birds are white and are tinged with yellow and streaked black. The head is strongly patterned in yellow and black, with a flaming-orange throat. Other plumages, including the fall male and adult female, are washed-out versions of the summer male, and in particular lack the bright colors and strong head pattern. Blackburnian warblers are practically unmistakable if seen well, even the females due to their dull-yellow supercilium, contrasting with greyish cheeks and yellow throat contrasting with the dark streaky sides and back."
honey badger,mellivora capensis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Mustelidae_Mellivorinae_Mellivora_Mellivora capensis,"The Honey badger is a large species of mustelid family. These animals have small eyes and a large skull. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular. The hind feet of the animal are small, having short claws, whereas the front feet are, conversely, strong and wide, having large claws, which help the animal in catching prey and running. Being thick and loose, their skin is extremely difficult to seize for predators. Meanwhile, it allows the animal to extricate itself and bite the opponent. Different subspecies of the Honey badger vary in color. However, as a general rule, the animal is dark black ventrally, having the characteristic dorsal mantle, which is typically grey or bright white, extending the whole length of its body and turning to black at the base of the tail."
splendid fairy-wren,malurus splendens,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Passeriformes_Maluridae_Malurus_Malurus splendens,"The Splendid fairy-wren is a small, long-tailed bird found across much of the Australian continent. The breeding male is distinctive with a predominantly bright blue and black coloration. The non-breeding male is brown with blue in the wings and a bluish tail. The female resembles the non-breeding male but has a chestnut bill and eye-patch. Both males and females molt in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They will molt again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Some older males, however, may remain blue all year, molting directly from one year's nuptial plumage to the next."

Its high-domed, dark carapace has brilliant yellow markings that radiate out from the center of all its plates to make this tortoise's distinctive pattern. The shell’s dark pigment fades as the individual grows older, producing a shell of a lighter color. Males have longer tails and their under shell or plastron has a notch below the tail. Hatchlings are black and off-white, but soon develop the striking adult coloration."
ribbon seal,histriophoca fasciata,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Pinnipedia_Phocidae_Histriophoca_Histriophoca fasciata,"The Ribbon seal is an ice seal, one of nine species. The adult coat has a dark background encircled with four light-colored stripes. One stripe goes around the neck and around the mid-rear section of the seal's body, the others start ventrally and go around the fore flippers on each side. Although all Ribbon seals have this general pattern, there is great individual variability regarding the precise location and the shade of the stripes. Babies and juveniles do not have such a pattern, newborns being completely white, and juvenile seals dark dorsally and anteriorally, and grayish ventrally and posteriorly. Males are usually darker than females. Ribbon seals have big eyes and small teeth."
sumatran rhinoceros,dicerorhinus sumatrensis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Perissodactyla_Rhinocerotidae_Dicerorhinus_Dicerorhinus sumatrensis,"A Sumatran rhinoceros is the smallest amongst the living rhinos and the only one of Asian rhinos with two horns. Its shaggy appearance is its best known feature, due to the long, coarse hair covering much of its body. As it grows older, this hair falls out, meaning that its age can, to a certain extent, be determined by how hairy it is. Underneath, its hide has a red undertone, making this rhino unique in appearance. Its hairiness suggests to many scientists that it may be a direct descendant of the woolly rhinoceros, extinct for about 10,000 years. Sumatran rhinos, along with the Javan rhino, are the most threatened rhino species. Sumatran rhinos outnumber Javan rhinos, but are more under threat by poaching. They were declared extinct in Malaysia in the wild in 2015."

okapi,okapia johnstoni,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Giraffidae_Okapia_Okapia johnstoni,"The okapi was not discovered until 1901. Okapia johnstoni, its taxonomic name, honors its native Central African name, as well as the man who ‘discovered’ it, the British explorer Sir Harry Johnston, naturalist and colonial administrator. Native pygmies in Central Africa had known about this animal, which they thought of as a type of horse, for generations, and this was the description of it they gave to Sir Henry Morton Stanley (the man who found Dr Livingtone, reportedly with the words, ‘Dr. Livingstone, I presume’). The okapi is, in fact, a forest-dwelling relative of the giraffe."

The head of the animal is small, eyes are round and the muzzle is short. The pale wool of the animal is generally tawny colored while the belly is white. They have rosettes all over their body and tail, while the tip of the tail is often ringed. The animals exhibit four stripes on their forehead, running down to their necks. Various populations of Leopard cats differ in coat length and color, depending on habitat and environmental conditions of the area. Thus, in northern parts of their range, the animals are usually heavier, showing paler and longer coat. Meanwhile, those, living in snowy habitats, exhibit lighter coat in contrast with cats, living in densely forested habitats and having dark-tawny fur."

The Collared kingfisher is a very widespread species and has numerous subspecies, belonging to the Halcyoninae subfamily, the tree kingfishers. They occur on three continents, namely Australia, Asia, and Africa, occupying a wide range within those continents. The subspecies vary slightly in size but the plumage color is the main variation, with upperparts being greener or bluer, the underparts ranging from buff to white, and the size of the white loral spot differing. Males and females are similar, but the upperparts of males usually are slightly bluer than those of females. Juveniles have a duller color than adults, a black collar band and very small, black scaling over the breast."
toque macaque,macaca sinica,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Primates_Haplorhini_Simiiformes_Cercopithecidae_Macaca_Macaca sinica,"This smallest macaque is a native Sri Lankan species with a golden-brown fur. The local people call Toque Macaque the “Rilawa”. The most characteristic feature of this primate is the toque-like swirl of hair on its head top. As a matter of fact, their physiological characteristics vary greatly, depending on climatic conditions. Thus, populations in cooler climate exhibit thick, dark brown coat as well as relatively short limbs and tails. Meanwhile, those inhabiting lowland rainforests typically display reddish or golden fur and longer bonnets. Populations in drier habitats have lighter fur, noticeably longer legs and tails as well as shorter swirl of hair on their head."

It has a black crown and back, pale grey cheek patches, and white underparts. Its broad boldly marked red and black beak and orange legs contrast with its plumage. It molts while at sea in the winter and some of the bright-colored facial characteristics are lost, with color returning again during the spring. The juvenile has similar plumage, but its cheek patches are dark grey. The juvenile does not have brightly colored head ornamentation, its bill is narrower and is dark-grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. Puffins from northern populations are typically larger than in the south and these populations are generally considered a different subspecies."

It is a European branch of the weasel or Mustelidae family. It is the otter species with the widest distribution, being spread widely across Europe. It is an elusive animal which has sleek brown fur, often paler on its underside, covering its long lithe body, thick tail and little legs. Adaptations to an aquatic lifestyle are its webbed feet, its ability to close its small ears and its nose when it is under water, and its very dense, short fur that traps a layer of air for the purpose of insulating the animal. It has many sensitive whiskers around its snout; these help to locate prey."

The male (peacock) is brightly colored, with a predominantly blue fan-like crest of spatula-tipped wire-like feathers and is best known for the long train (tail) made up of elongated upper-tail covert feathers which bear colorful eyespots. These stiff feathers are raised into a fan and quivered in a display during courtship. Despite the length and size of these covert feathers, peacocks are still capable of flight. Females (peahens) lack the train and have a greenish lower neck and duller brown plumage. Downy chicks are pale buff with a dark brown mark on the nape that connects with the eyes. Young males look like the females but their wings are chestnut colored."

It was though to have become extinct during the early 20th century. However, in 2000, one was accidentally killed by Indonesian scientists while trapping rats. The first of this species seen at large since the 1920s were discovered by researchers from Texas A&M University in Lore Lindu National Park on Mount Rore Katimbo in August 2008. This animal’s coat is longer and more curly than that of other tarsiers, perhaps as an adaptation to its cold damp environment. Its coat is very soft, ranging in color from buff to grayish brown or dark brown."
atlantic spotted dolphin,stenella frontalis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Cetacea_Delphinidae_Stenella_Stenella frontalis,"This dolphin most frequently occurs in the clear and shallow waters around the Bahamas. By its appearance, the Atlantic spotted dolphin is an intermediate between pantropical spotted dolphin and the bottlenose dolphin. Despite the name, not all individuals of this species exhibit spots on their body, though many of them do. However, some dolphins are so densely spotted, that may seem to be completely white from afar. As a general rule, calf dolphins normally lack these spots, developing them as they grow up. On the other hand, those living in the far-offshore waters of the Gulf Stream are often smaller and without spots on their body."

cuvier's beaked whale,ziphius cavirostris,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Cetacea_Ziphiidae_Ziphius_Ziphius cavirostris,"Cuvier's beaked whale is widely distributed in offshore waters of all oceans. The color of their skin may vary greatly from individual to individual, though usually it ranges from dark slate-grey to rusty brown. As the animals age, the color on their head, neck and back lightens, which is more noticeable in male individuals. Thus, the skin color of head in old males seems to be almost entirely white. In addition, adult males of this species are easily identified by two large, cylindrical teeth, incongruously projecting from the tip of their lower jaw. In 1823, the French naturalist Georges Cuvier took a fragment of skull for a fossil, describing it as an extinct whale species. Then, several decades after the scientist's death, the 'extinct species' turned out to be a living and widespread mammal, today known as Cuvier’s beaked whale."

argentine black and white tegu,salvator merianae,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Teiidae_Salvator_Salvator merianae,"The Argentine black and white tegu is a large lizard native to South America. These lizards are popular as pets because they have unusually high intelligence and can also be house-broken. As hatchlings, these tegus have an emerald green color from the tip of their snout to midway down their neck with black markings. The emerald green becomes black several months after shedding. As a young tegu, the tail is banded yellow and black; as it ages, the solid yellow bands nearest the body change to areas of weak speckling. Fewer solid bands indicate an older animal. A tegu can drop a section of its tail as a distraction if attacked. The tail is also used as a weapon to swipe at an aggressor; even a half-hearted swipe can leave a bruise.

This animal is an Old World monkey, endemic to Central Africa. In the past, the Golden monkey wasn't recognized as separate species, being considered a subspecies of the Blue monkey. In fact, these two monkeys are closely related and very similar. The ongoing divisions of forests has led to fragmentation of their range and Cercopithecus species have lived in isolated populations, where they have adapted to local environment. As a result, the Golden monkey has diverged from the Blue monkey. This endangered animal is one of the eight subspecies of the Blue monkey. Females of the golden monkey exhibit lighter coloration as well as less grizzled brown patches. However, there is very little information on the behavior and ecology of this species due to lack of observations."

Their adult plumage is white, and there are some black feathers on the wings and tail. The plumage dulls quickly due to the bird’s habit of stalking around a carcass, waiting its turn, on ground that is usually dusty, so before a molt the feathers are beige more than pure white. Individuals also occasionally cover themselves with soil that contains iron oxide, which makes their plumage a pinkish buff, giving them the name Schmutzgeier in German (""dirt-vulture""). The smallest of Europe’s four vulture species, the Egyptian vulture is also the most endangered of these four."

african buffalo,syncerus caffer,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Artiodactyla_Bovidae_Bovinae_Syncerus_Syncerus caffer,"African buffalo are large, heavy cow-like animals native to Africa. They are widely regarded as among the most dangerous animals on the African continent, and according to some estimates they gore, trample, and kill over 200 people every year. Compared with other large bovids, African buffalo have a long but stocky body and short but thickset legs, resulting in a relatively short standing height. The adult buffalo's horns are its characteristic feature: they have fused bases, forming a continuous bone shield across the top of the head referred to as a ""boss"". Savannah-type buffalo have black or dark brown coats with age. Old bulls often have whitish circles around their eyes and on their face. Females tend to have more-reddish coats. Forest-type buffaloes are 30-40% smaller, reddish-brown in color, with much more hair growth around the ears and with horns that curve back and slightly up. Calves of both types have red coats."
bengal fox,vulpes bengalensis,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Carnivora_Caniformia_Canidae_Vulpes_Vulpes bengalensis,"The Bengal fox, also known as the Indian fox, is a species of Asian foxes endemic to the Indian subcontinent. This is a medium-sized fox with an elongated muzzle with black hair in small patches on the upper part of the muzzle. Its large, bushy, black-tipped tail is its most prominent feature, accounting for as much as 60% of the length of its body. Usually the tail trails behind but when the fox is running, it carries its tail horizontally, then holds it vertically when making sudden turns. The color of the fox’s coat varies according to the season and within a population but is usually gray on the back and paler on the belly, with dark brown on the ears, with black edges. Their ears are large in comparison to their body and are possibly an adaptation for thermoregulation in their hot and dry habitats."
eurasian collared dove,streptopelia decaocto,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Columbiformes_Columbidae_Streptopelia_Streptopelia decaocto,"During the 20th century, the Eurasian collared dove spectacularly expanded its range from the Middle East to right across Europe. Accidentally introduced in 1974 into the Bahamas, this pale chunky bird soon spread to the mainland in Florida. A relative of the mourning dove, its name comes from its black half-collar around its neck. It has white tail feathers and dark-tipped wings. It is often seen on fence posts and telephone wires, giving its rhythmic three-part coo."

Contrary to their name, they may also be a shade of grey or black as well as brown and are darker on the head and underparts. Their fur is soft, short and thick. Their face is naked of any fur and is typically black. Brown woolly monkeys have long limbs and prehensile tail, which help them to move easily through the forest. Most male woolly monkeys are larger than the females and have larger canines."
brahminy blind snake,indotyphlops braminus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Typhlopidae_Indotyphlops_Indotyphlops braminus,"The Brahminy blind snake is a nonvenomous blind snake species found mostly in Africa and Asia but has been introduced in many other parts of the world. They are completely fossorial (i.e., burrowing) animals, with habits and appearance similar to earthworms, for which they are often mistaken. Brahminy blind snakes are the smallest known snake species in the world. Their head and tail are superficially similar as the head and neck are indistinct. Unlike other snakes, the head scales resemble the body scales. The eyes are barely discernible as small dots under the head scales. The tip of the tail has a small, pointed spur. Along the body are fourteen rows of dorsal scales. Coloration ranges from charcoal gray, silver-gray, light yellow-beige, purplish, or infrequently albino, the ventral surface is more pale. The coloration of the juvenile form is similar to that of the adult. The tiny eyes are covered with translucent scales which means that these snakes are almost entirely blind. Their eyes cannot form images but can react to light intensity."
gelada,theropithecus gelada,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Mammalia_Primates_Haplorhini_Simiiformes_Cercopithecidae_Cercopithecinae_Papionini_Theropithecus_Theropithecus gelada,"Geladas are easily recognizable primates due to the identifying hairless patches of skin on their chests. During the mating season, these chest patches acquire bright crimson coloration in females. These primates are sometimes called Gelada baboons. However, they aren't baboons. Instead, Geladas form a separate genus of their own. Additionally, they are the last surviving member of a grass-grazing primate group, members of which were abundant and widespread in the past. Geladas are well adapted to their terrestrial lifestyle. These animals are specialist grass-eating primates. Their small, powerful fingers are designed for pulling grass, while small incisors allow them to chew it. When eating, Geladas move around with characteristic shuffle gait. When walking, they use all of their four limbs and slide their feet without changing the body posture, so that the bright red patch on their chest is conspicuous, whereas the rump remains hidden. Captive Geladas are known to live more than 30 years. Life expectancy of those in the wild in unknown, although it's believed to be shorter than that of captive individuals."
corn snake,pantherophis guttatus,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Squamata_Serpentes_Colubridae_Pantherophis_Pantherophis guttatus,"The Corn snake is a North American species of rat snake. Their docile nature, reluctance to bite, moderate adult size, attractive pattern, and comparatively simple care make them commonly kept pet snakes. Though superficially resembling the venomous copperhead and often killed as a result of this mistaken identity, Corn snakes are harmless and beneficial to humans. These snakes are usually orange or yellowish-brown in color with large, black-edged red blotches down their back. There are black and white marks on their bellies, which resemble a checkerboard pattern. Corn snakes are named for their regular presence near grain stores, where they prey on mice and rats that eat harvested corn."

They also have a dark brown to black coat and long, dark-colored hair between their forelegs and under their belly. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-colored fur. Males are darker than females. Black wildebeests have bushy and dark-tipped manes that stick up from the back of the neck. Both sexes have strong horns that curve forward, resembling hooks. The horns have a broad base in mature males and are flattened to form a protective shield. In females, the horns are both shorter and narrower. Black wildebeests have scent glands that secrete a glutinous substance in front of the eyes, under the hair tufts, and on the forefeet."
american golden plover,pluvialis dominica,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Charadriiformes_Charadriidae_Pluvialis_Pluvialis dominica,"The American golden plover is a medium-sized wading bird that makes one of the longest migratory journeys of any shorebird. The breeding male has a black face, neck, breast, and belly, with a white crown and nape that extends to the side of the breast. The back is mottled black and white with pale, gold spots. The breeding female is similar, but with less black. When in winter plumage, both sexes have grey-brown upperparts, pale gray-brown underparts, and a whitish eyebrow.

northern map turtle,graptemys geographica,Animalia_Chordata_Vertebrata_Reptilia_Testudines_Cryptodira_Emydidae_Graptemys_Graptemys geographica,"The Northern map turtle is an aquatic turtle native to North America. It gets both its common and scientific names from the markings on its carapace, which resemble contour lines on a map or chart. These lines are usually shades of yellow, tan, or orange, and are surrounded by dark borders, with the rest of the carapace being olive or greyish brown. However, the carapace markings tend to fade as the animal matures, and in older individuals are usually only visible when the shell is wet. The plastron is yellowish and is marked by a central dark blotch (plastral figure) that follows the sutures of the plastral scutes and fades with age so that many adults lack a pattern all together. The head, neck, limbs, and tail are dark green with thin yellow stripes, and an oval or triangular spot is located behind each eye. Females have a much wider head than males and this is associated with differences in feeding. Males have a narrower carapace with a more distinct keel, narrower head, and a longer, thicker tail."
burrowing owl,athene cunicularia,Animalia_Chordata_Aves_Strigiformes_Strigidae_Athene_Athene cunicularia,"Burrowing owls are small, long-legged birds of prey found throughout open terrains of North and South America. They have bright eyes and their beaks can be dark yellow or gray depending on the subspecies. They have prominent white eyebrows and a white ""chin"" patch which they expand and display during certain behaviors, such as a bobbing of the head when agitated. Adults have brown heads and wings with white spotting. The chest and abdomen are white with variable brown spotting or barring, also depending on the subspecies. Juvenile owls are similar in appearance, but they lack most of the white spotting above and brown barring below; their breast may be buff-colored rather than white. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, Burrowing owls have developed longer legs that enable them to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting."
